GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE VERIFICATION
====================================

Since your site is hosted on GitHub Pages, the easiest verification method is the HTML TAG method.

STEP-BY-STEP:

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console/
   Click "Start now" and sign in with your Google account.

2. Click "Add property" (top left dropdown)

3. Choose "URL prefix" (NOT Domain)
   Enter: https://thesabbirahmed.github.io/
   Click Continue

4. Under "Verify ownership", choose:
   "HTML tag" method

5. Google will give you a meta tag like this:
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" />

6. Open your index.html in GitHub
   Add that tag INSIDE your <head> section, right after:
   <meta name="author" content="Sabbir Ahmed">

7. Commit the change.

8. Wait 2-3 minutes, then click "Verify" in Search Console.

9. Once verified, go to:
   Sitemaps (left sidebar) > Add a new sitemap
   Enter: sitemap.xml
   Click Submit

DONE. Google will now actively crawl and index your site.
